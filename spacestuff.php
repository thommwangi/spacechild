                <h2>Astronauts</h2>
                <p>Every two years, NASA must choose new members of the astronaut corps.
                     Thousands of people from all over the world apply to become NASA 
                     astronauts, but only about twenty are chosen. In order to become 
                     an astronaut, a person must work well with people, be able to communicate
                      well, be eager to do the job, have work experience, have good grades, 
                      and have a college degree. Most future astronauts take a lot of science 
                      and math. It is very hard, and sometimes very dangerous, to be an astronaut.
                        Once selected to join the astronaut corps, training begins at the Johnson
                         Space Center in Houston, Texas. Astronauts practice all of the jobs they
                          will need to know during their space mission. They practice these jobs 
                          many, many times. Some astronauts learn to drive the Space Shuttle. 
                          Some are trained to perform jobs like science experiments or spacewalks.</p>

                        <h2>Hubble Space Telescope</h2>
                        <p>The Hubble Space Telescope was launched on the Space Shuttle on April 24, 
                            1990. It is a very special telescope which orbits far above the Earth.
                             Hubble allows us to see objects more clearly because it is above the 
                             clouds in Earth's atmosphere. These clouds block the view of the 
                             Earth-based telescopes which scientists have used for many years. 
                             Hubble is not only a powerful telescope, but it also carries cameras
                              which allow scientists on Earth to see objects billions of light-years away.
                               Hubble runs on solar power. Scientists in Greenbelt, Maryland control 
                               it using radio signals. The Hubble Space Telescope was built to last for 
                               at least 15 years. Astronauts from the Space Shuttle make visits to Hubble 
                               so they can give it a "check-up". Everyone wants to keep Hubble in perfect 
                               working condition so it will continue to send back amazing pictures to us 
                               here on Earth.</p>

                        <h2>Space Probes</h2>
                        <p>Space probes are made to conduct science experiments. They do not have people 
                            on them. Space probes have helped scientists get information about our solar 
                            system. Most probes are not designed to return to Earth. Some have landed on
                             other planets! Others have flown past the planets and taken pictures of them
                              for scientists to see. There are even some space probes that go into orbit
                               around other planets and study them for a long time. The information they
                                gather is used to help us understand the weather and other changes which
                                 happen on planets other than the Earth. This information is important 
                                 in helping to plan other space missions such as ones to Mars and to 
                                 Saturn.</p>

                        <h2>Space Travel</h2>
                        <p>The space age began in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, 
                            the world's first man-made satellite. Also in 1957, Sputnik 2 was launched 
                            carrying a dog named Laika. Laika was the first animal to orbit the Earth. 
                            In 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first human to pilot a spacecraft when he 
                            was launched aboard Vostok 1 by the Soviet Union. Later that year, Alan 
                            Shepard became the first American to pilot a spacecraft. He was followed
                             by John Glenn, who orbited the Earth three times in 1962.
                             In 1963, the United States and the Soviet Union started a race to see
                              who could put a man on the Moon first. In 1969, the United States won
                               when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on
                                the Moon's surface.</p>

                        <h2>Space Wardrobe</h2>
                        <p>Astronauts need special clothes to protect them so they can live and work in space.
                             In fact, astronauts need a lot of clothes! They have a special suit they wear
                              during launch and re-entry. It protects them from the changes in pressure that
                               happen when you come and go from space. This suit has a helmet, gloves,
                                and boots. Once in orbit, they wear shirts and pants that are just like 
                                the clothes we wear here on the ground. To go outside their spacecraft 
                                while they are in orbit, they have a special suit called an "extravehicular 
                                mobility unit", or EMU. It has a way to keep the astronaut cool, a
                                 headphone/microphone so the astronaut can talk to the Shuttle, oxygen 
                                 for breathing, and water to drink. If they want to move freely through
                                  space, they wear a special backpack called the "manned maneuvering unit" 
                                  or MMU.</p>
